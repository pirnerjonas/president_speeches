### Used libraries ###
`spacy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`

### Project Motivation ###
In this repository I analyze the **inaugural address corpus**. This textual data source has the uncommon characteristic that it also contains a time component which makes it very interesting for analyzation. The main questions that I tried to answer were:

- *"What are some common topics in the speeches?"*
- *"How important were war and peace over time?"*
- *"What were important words during war and peace peaks?"*

### Results ###
The main findings of the code can be found at https://pirnerjonas.github.io/2020/04/07/war-and-peace.html
